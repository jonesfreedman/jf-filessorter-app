Moves files to respective folders based on their extension. 

Run the service and go to:
https://localhost:44324/swagger/index.html   - (I guess the port(44324) may change)

Once you are in Swagger UI, 
  1. click on "POST"
  2. click on "Try it out"
  3. In the respose body, replace "string" with the location that you want to sort.
      Ex: "E:\\Other\\Test"  (Use two slashes in the address - \\ - instead of one).
